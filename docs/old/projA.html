<p>This document will be updated as issues arise and new questions emerge. All deadlines are on the <a href="calendar.qmd">Calendar</a>.</p>
<section id="project-a-overview" class="level1">
<h1>Project A Overview</h1>
<p>In Project A, you will be analyzing, presenting and discussing a pair of regression models, specifically a linear regression and a logistic regression, describing a data set (available to the public) that you identify.</p>
<p>There are two main deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Project A Plan, due in mid-February when the <a href="calendar.qmd">Calendar</a> says it is.</li>
<li>The Project A Portfolio and Presentation, due right after Spring Break, as the <a href="calendar.qmd">Calendar</a> indicates.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Project A work is to be submitted <a href="https://canvas.case.edu/">via Canvas</a>.</p>
<section id="templates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>On our <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data">432-data page</a>, you will find (in the templates subfolder) a pair of Quarto templates: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/master/templates/projectAplan_template.qmd">one for the Project A Plan</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/master/templates/projectAportfolio_template.qmd">another for the Project A Portfolio</a>. Please use these templates in preparing your work. They will make completing and grading Project A much easier.</p>
</section>
<section id="working-with-a-partner" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-a-partner">Working with a Partner?</h2>
<p>You can choose either to work alone, or with one other person, to complete Project A. If you work in a group for Project A, you may be asked to work alone for Project B later in the term.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to identify your Project A partner prior to the submission of your Project A Plan.</li>
<li>If you are working with a partner, all work must be submitted by exactly one of you to <a href="https::/canvas.case.edu">Canvas</a> while the non-reporting partner submits a one-page note to Canvas indicating the members of the partnership and that the partner will submit the work.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sanity-checks-and-false-starts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sanity-checks-and-false-starts">Sanity Checks and False Starts</h2>
<p>Sanity checks are an important part of your programming, but they don’t belong in your final plan, portfolio or presentation. Neither do false starts, and explorations that don’t lead anywhere.</p>

<section id="choosing-your-data" class="level1">
<h1>Choosing Your Data</h1>
<section id="what-makes-a-data-set-acceptable" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-a-data-set-acceptable">What Makes a Data Set Acceptable?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Shared with the World</strong>. The data must be available to you, and shared with me and everyone else in the world (without any identifying information) as a well-tidied file by the time you submit your Project A Plan. If the data is from another source, the source (web or other) must be completely identified to me. Ongoing projects that require anyone’s approval to share data are not appropriate for Project A.
<ul>
<li>You should have the data in R by 2023-02-01, so that you will have sufficient time to complete the other elements of this Plan. Any data you cannot have by that time is a bad choice.</li>
<li>For Project A, you may not use any data set used in the 431 or 432 teaching materials.</li>
<li>You must use meaningfully different data sets in 432 Projects A and B.</li>
<li>In submitting your Project A Plan, you will need to be able to write “I am certain that it is completely appropriate for these data to be shared with anyone, without any conditions. There are no concerns about privacy or security.” So be sure that’s true before you pick a data set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>.
<ul>
<li>A <strong>minimum</strong> of 100 complete observations are required on each variable. It is fine if there are some missing values, as well, so long as there are at least 100 rows with complete observations on all variables you intend to use in each model.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum</strong> data set size is 1200 observations, so if you have something larger than that, you’ll need to select a random subset of the available information as part of your data tidying process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>. The columns must include one quantitative outcome and one binary categorical outcome.
<ul>
<li>We prefer distinct outcomes, but if necessary, the binary outcome can be generated from the quantitative outcome (as an example, your quantitative outcome could be resting heart rate in beats per minute, and your binary outcome could be whether the resting heart rate is below 70 beats per minute.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inputs</strong>. You will need at least four regression inputs (predictors) for each of your two models.
<ul>
<li>At least one of the four must be quantitative (a variable is <strong>not</strong> quantitative for this purpose unless it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values), <em>and</em> at least one must be multi-categorical (with between 3 and 6 categories, each containing a minimum of 30 subjects) for each model.</li>
<li>Your other inputs can represent binary, multi-categorical or quantitative data.</li>
<li>You can examine different candidate predictors for each outcome, or use the same ones in both your linear and logistic regression models.</li>
<li>Depending on your sample size, you can study more than the minimum number of regression inputs. See specifications below for your <a href="#my-planned-predictors-linear-model">linear</a> and <a href="#my-planned-predictors-logistic-model">logistic</a> models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Your data need not be related to health, or medicine, or biology.</p>
<section id="no-hierarchical-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-hierarchical-data">No hierarchical data</h3>
<p>In each project this semester, we will require you to study cross-sectional data, where rows indicate subjects and columns indicate variables gathered to describe those subjects at a particular moment in time or space. Do not use “nested” data in Project A.</p>
<ul>
<li>One example of hierarchical (nested) data would be a model of patient results that contains measures not just for individual patients but also measures for the providers within which patients are grouped, and also for health systems in which providers are grouped. That wouldn’t work for this project.</li>
<li>Another example of hierarchical (nested) data would be a model of individual people’s outcomes where the covariates are gathered at the state or county level, as well as at the level of individuals, and again, that doesn’t work for this project.</li>
<li>The singular exception to the “no hierarchical data” rule is that it will usually be acceptable for all inputs to be collected at a single (baseline) time point and both outcomes to be collected at a single future point in time. For example, you could predict systolic blood pressure in 2022 (or whether or not a subject’s systolic blood pressure in 2022 was below 140), based on a set of input variables (likely including systolic blood pressure) all gathered in 2021.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="joining-multiple-data-sets">Joining multiple data sets</h3>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Love will be especially impressed with a data collection effort that <em>appropriately</em> puts together at least two different data bases, should that be appropriate.</p>
<p>What we have in mind are the following scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Multiple data sets describing different variables for the same subjects that can be linked, so that you can build a combined data set with the same subjects but pulling together multiple sources of data, as, for example, the County Health Rankings do each year.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple data sets describing different subjects but the same variables, such as different years of a survey, combining, for instance, multiple iterations of NHANES so as to increase the available sample size.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If your project research questions and available data lead to one of these approaches, great. If not, don’t force it.</p>
<p>This may require you to learn something about the various joining commands, like <code>left_join</code> and <code>inner_join</code> that are highlighted in the Combine Data Sets section on the <a href="https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-transformation-1.pdf">Data Transformation Cheat Sheet</a> from <a href="https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/">Posit</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We heartily recommend Garret Grolemund’s YouTube materials on Data Wrangling, for instance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuBgYDCg1Cg">this Introduction to Data Manipulation</a> which is about combining multiple data sets.</li>
<li>Another great resource for combining data sets (and most of your other R questions) is the second edition of <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, by Wickham and Grolemund.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="good-data-sets-to-use">Good Data Sets To Use</h2>
<p>Some sources of data we’d like to see people use include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/">CDC WONDER</a> data, which could (at the county level) be combined with data from <a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/">County Health Rankings 2022</a> to do something interesting.</li>
<li>The data sets described in the American Statistical Association’s <a href="https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/events/datachallengeexpo2022">Data Challenge Expo</a> for 2022, which include five very interesting data sets selected from the Urban Institute Data Catalog</li>
<li>A data set from the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday archive</a> or from the <a href="https://dataset-finder.netlify.app/">Data is Plural archive</a> might be a good candidate.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/public-survey-data?_ga=2.79574685.849210420.1612760982-241136149.1612760982">Health and Retirement Study</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a> although the problem there is a lack of quantitative variables.</li>
<li>The many many public use data sets available at <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/">ICSPR</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places&amp;sortBy=newest&amp;utf8">500 Cities and PLACES data portal</a>, most probably focusing on the <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb">County-level data</a> and potentially combining it with <a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/">County Health Rankings 2022</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_data.htm">National Center on Health Statistics</a> which includes NHANES (not a good choice for this project) but also other data sets.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>While data on COVID-19 would be permitted for 432 projects, most of the available data is longitudinal and thus unsuitable for Project A.</li>
<li>We are not interested in people using NHANES data in Project A, or County Health Rankings data, unless (as indicated above) those County Health Rankings are combined with meaningful additional data sets.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle Public Datasets</a> may be permitted, but we discourage this. We will only accept those with really useful variables, no hierarchical structure and strong descriptions of how the data were gathered (which is at best 5% of what’s available on Kaggle). Don’t select a Kaggle data set without running it by us on Campuswire (<a href="#running-a-data-set-past-us-for-project-a">see below</a>) to see if we’re willing to let you use it.</li>
<li>You will not be permitted to use data from a textbook or other educational resource for learning statistics, data science or related methods (online or otherwise).
<ul>
<li>Examples of such repositories (that are sadly out-of-bounds for this project and for 432 Project B) include the <a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/datasets/">Cleveland Clinic Statistical Education dataset repository</a>, the <a href="https://hbiostat.org/data/">Vanderbilt University Biostatistics Datasets</a>, or the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</li>

<p>To get Professor Love and the TAs to “sign off” on a data set as appropriate for your Project A Plan, you need to tell us the following four things in a (private or public - your choice) note on <a href="https://campuswire.com/">Campuswire</a> in the <code>Project A</code> folder. Please do this if you’re not sure your data set is appropriate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the data source, as <a href="#data-source">described here</a>, along with a URL so we can access the data</li>
<li>a description of who the subjects are and how they were selected, as <a href="#the-subjects">described here</a> - it helps if you also tell us how many subjects are in the data.</li>
<li>what quantitative outcome you plan to use in your linear regression model, including its units of measurement and the minimum, mean and maximum values available in your data</li>
<li>what binary outcome you plan to use in your logistic regression model, specifying both of the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories and how many subjects fall into each of those two categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, we ask that you not ask us to pick between two “options” - submit the one you’d rather do. If it’s a problem, we’ll let you know, and you can then change to another option if necessary.</p>

<p>Tidy and clean up the data to meet all necessary requirements for your modeling work. This will require multiple sub-sections as you tackle different tasks for different sets of variables. Use the tidyverse for data management whenever possible. Some of things you need to do here…</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate all variables that are not going to be used (either as identifiers, outcomes or inputs) in your planned analyses.</li>
<li>Change variable names to more meaningful ones, although it’s helpful to keep them at 10 characters or less. Use <code>clean_names()</code> from the <code>janitor</code> package to clean up and standardize the presentation of variable names.</li>
<li>Sample the data as needed to ensure that you meet the data set size specifications (no more than 1200 rows, for instance.)</li>
<li>Convert all variables to appropriate types (factors, etc.) as needed, and complete appropriate checks of the values for all variables.</li>
<li>If you have prospective inputs (predictors) that are multi-categorical with more than 6 categories, collapse them to six or fewer categories in a rational way at this stage.</li>
<li>Ensure that all categorical variables have at least 30 observations at each level, collapsing or removing levels as needed to accomplish this end.</li>
<li>Your tidied data set should be arranged with a row (subject) identifier at the far left. That identifier should have a unique value for each row, and should be saved as a character variable in R.</li>
<li>We expect your final tibble to have some missing values. Do not impute or delete these, but do be sure they are correctly identified as missing values by R.</li>
<li>Do not list the entire tibble or print out large strands of R output (like summaries of the entire tibble) anywhere in your document, except where you are required by these instructions to do so.</li>

<ul>
<li>This should be a listing, not a glimpse or anything else. Just type in the name of your tibble.</li>

<ul>
<li>The name of the variable in your tibble.</li>

<section id="my-first-research-question" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-first-research-question">6.1 My First Research Question</h4>
<p>Begin this section by specifying a question that you hope to answer with the linear model you are proposing. A research question relates clearly to the data you have and your modeling plans, and, like all questions, it ends with a question mark. Eventually, you will need to answer this question in your portfolio.</p>
<p>Jeff Leek in his book “<a href="https://leanpub.com/modernscientist">How to be a Modern Scientist</a>” has some excellent advice in his section on “How Do You Start a Paper.” In particular, you want to identify research questions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are concrete, (and for which you can find useful data), and that</li>
<li>solve a real problem, and that</li>
<li>give you an opportunity to do something new,</li>
<li>that you will feel ownership of, and</li>
<li>that you want to work on.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend you use the FINER criteria (or, if relevant, the PICOT criteria) to help you refine a vague notion of a research question into something appropriate for this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>FINER = Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical and Relevant.</li>
<li>PICOT is often used in medical studies assessing or evaluating patients and includes Patient (or Problem), Intervention (or Indicator), Comparison group, Outcomes and Time.</li>
</ul>

<li>Provide a count of the number of rows in your data with complete information on this outcome.</li>
<li>Provide a nicely labeled graphical summary of the distribution of your outcome to supplement the numerical description you provided in Section 5.2.</li>
<li>Comment briefly on the characteristics of the outcome’s distribution. Is your outcome skewed or symmetric, is it discrete or fairly continuous, is there a natural transformation to consider?</li>

<section id="new-section-8.-linear-regression-analyses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-section-8.-linear-regression-analyses">New Section 8. Linear Regression Analyses</h3>
<p>In Section 8, we expect you to present all relevant code used to produce your final results. No output should be presented in this section (or in Section 9) without commentary. This should describe the fitting and evaluation of two models: a “main effects” model (model A), and an “augmented” model (model B). We’re primarily interested in a clear presentation. The following eight elements should be presented, in properly labeled subsections of section 8, using the labels in bold below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Missingness</strong> your approach to dealing with missing data, if applicable
<ul>
<li>we prefer imputation (simple or multiple) to complete case analysis</li>
<li>if you have a sample with no missing data, specify that (again) here</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome Transformation</strong> your approach to transforming the outcome variable, including an appropriate Box-Cox assessment</li>
<li><strong>Scatterplot Matrix and Collinearity</strong> a scatterplot matrix including the (possibly transformed) outcome and all predictors that make it into your “main effects” model
<ul>
<li>be sure to evaluate collinearity between predictors, either through perusing and discussing the correlations in the scatterplot matrix, or with variance inflation factors</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model A</strong>: your initial “main effects” model
<ul>
<li>remember that your model must include at least four predictors, of which at least one must be quantitative and one must be multi-categorical</li>
<li>we discourage the use of stepwise or other model selection strategies, instead please use your problem-based understanding to select variables and use them all.</li>
<li>in presenting your main effects model you should show:
<ul>
<li>a tidied table of regression coefficients</li>
<li>key fit summary statistics like R-square, AIC and BIC, and</li>
<li>the four key diagnostic plots of residuals, with an appropriate interpretation of what you see</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non-Linearity</strong> your process for making decisions about how to capture potential non-linearity
<ul>
<li>what did the Spearman <span class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span> plot suggest and how did you spend your degrees of freedom?
<ul>
<li>If the (apparently strongest - furthest to the right) predictor in the <span class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span> plot is quantitative, you should be thinking first about a restricted cubic spline with 4 or 5 knots,</li>
<li>If the largest <span class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span> is associated with a binary or a multi-categorical predictor, create an interaction term with the second-largest <span class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span> predictor.</li>
<li>If you still have degrees of freedom you’re willing to spend after this, proceed down to the second largest predictor in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\rho^2\)</span>, and proceed similarly to the third largest after that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regardless of your sample size, please use about 6 additional degrees of freedom beyond the main effects model to account for non-linearity, and add at most 3 non-linear terms to your model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model B</strong>: fitting your “augmented model” incorporating non-linear terms
<ul>
<li>unless you’re doing multiple imputation you’ll want to be sure you demonstrate that you can fit this using either <code>ols</code> or <code>lm</code>, since you might need either approach for a complete assessment of the model (if you’re doing multiple imputation, you can stick with <code>ols</code>)</li>
<li>you’ll need to present a plot of the effects from <code>plot(summary(modelname))</code> for this augmented model, using <code>ols</code></li>
<li>you’ll also need to present the residual plots for the model you’ve fit, which is easiest to do if you fit the model with <code>lm</code>. If you’ve used multiple imputation, prepare a residuals vs.&nbsp;fitted values plot and evaluate it using <code>ols</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Validating the Models</strong> the results of a validation comparison of the “augmented model” B to the “main effects” model A which should help you select a “final model” from the two possibilities. You should produce validated <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> statistics for Models A and B within <code>ols</code> through the <code>validate</code> function. In addition, you might consider
<ul>
<li>an initial partition into training and test samples,</li>
<li>or a k-fold cross-validation strategy, should you deem that useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Final Model</strong> This section should end with a clear statement of the model you prefer (the “main effects model A” or the “augmented model B”) based on your overall assessment of fit quality, adherence to assumptions as seen in residuals, and whether adding the terms in the augmented model yields an improvement that is worth the complication of adding the non-linear terms. No output should be provided in this section without text annotation and commentary to clarify your results.
<ul>
<li>You should land on a single, final model, using both statistical and non-statistical considerations to make a decision between model A and model B.</li>
<li>An appropriate summary of the final model you landed on should start with a listing of the model parameters for a model fit to the entire data set (after imputation as needed) with appropriate confidence intervals, and a table or (better) plot of the effect sizes.</li>
<li>Specify the effect sizes for all elements of your final model numerically (with both a point estimate and a confidence interval), and graphically (with a plot of those effects (probably through <code>plot(summary(yourmodel)</code>).</li>
<li>Then write a detailed and correct description of the effect of <strong>at least one</strong> predictor on your outcome for your linear regression model, providing all necessary elements of such a description, and link this directly to what the plot is telling you.</li>
<li>We prefer you discuss a scientifically meaningful effect, should one exist. Pick an effect to describe that is interesting to you.</li>
<li>You should display an appropriate (corrected through validation) estimate of R-square for your final model</li>
<li>The final part of your summary of the final model should be a nomogram with a demonstration of a prediction (and appropriate prediction interval) for a new subject of interest.</li>
<li>Your prediction (and its prediction interval) should be back transformed to the original scale of your outcome, if you transformed your outcome before building your model.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="new-section-9.-logistic-regression-analyses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-section-9.-logistic-regression-analyses">New Section 9. Logistic Regression Analyses</h3>
<p>In Section 9, we expect you to present all relevant code used to produce your final results. As in Section 8, no output should be presented in this section without commentary. Also as in Section 8, this section will describe the fitting and evaluation of two models: a “main effects” model (model Y), and an “augmented” model (model Z). We’re primarily interested in a clear presentation. The following 6 elements should be presented, in properly labeled subsections of section 9, using the labels in bold below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Missingness</strong> your approach to dealing with missing data, if applicable
<ul>
<li>we prefer imputation (simple or multiple) to complete case analysis, but it’s not mandatory</li>
<li>if you have a sample with no missing data, specify that (again) here</li>
<li>you can use the same approach as in Section 8, or a different one, if you prefer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model Y</strong>: your initial “main effects” model
<ul>
<li>remember that your model must include at least four predictors, of which at least one must be quantitative and one must be multi-categorical.</li>
<li>we discourage the use of stepwise or other model selection strategies here, instead please use your problem-based understanding to select variables and use them all.</li>
<li>in presenting your main effects model you should show:
<ul>
<li>a tidied table of regression coefficients</li>
<li>a plot of the effects (on the odds ratio scale) for the model using <code>plot(summary(modelname))</code> from the <code>lrm</code> fit.</li>
<li>key fit summary statistics (Nagelkerke R-square and the area under the ROC curve) as they are presented in the <code>lrm</code> output</li>
<li>a confusion matrix based on an explicitly specified prediction rule (perhaps <code>.fitted</code> &gt;= 0.5, but something else if you prefer) and you’ll need to specify the specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value for this model.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non-Linearity</strong> your process for making decisions about how to capture potential non-linearity
<ul>
<li>what did the Spearman rho-squared plot suggest and how did you spend your degrees of freedom
<ul>
<li>If the (apparently strongest - furthest to the right) predictor in the rho-square plot is quantitative, you should be thinking first about a restricted cubic spline with 4 knots, maybe 5,</li>
<li>If the largest rho-square is associated with a binary or a multi-categorical predictor, create an interaction term with the second-largest rho-squared predictor.</li>
<li>If you still have degrees of freedom you’re willing to spend after this, proceed down to the second largest predictor in terms of rho-squared, and proceed similarly to the third largest after that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regardless of your sample size, please use between 3 and 6 additional degrees of freedom beyond the main effects model to account for non-linearity, and add no more than 3 non-linear terms to your model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model Z</strong>: fitting your “augmented model” incorporating non-linear terms
<ul>
<li>most of you will choose to use <code>lrm</code> to do most of this work, I’d expect, and that’s fine, but you’ll want to fit the model with <code>glm</code>, too, to help with building the confusion matrix.</li>
<li>you’ll need at a minimum to present a plot of the effects from <code>plot(summary(modelname))</code> for this augmented model, using <code>lrm</code>.</li>
<li>you’ll also need to show the Nagelkerke R-square and C statistic from the <code>lrm</code> output.</li>
<li>again, we’ll want you to produce an appropriate confusion matrix using the same prediction rule that you used in Model Y, and you’ll need to provide the specificity, sensitivity and PPV for Model Z using that prediction rule.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Validating the Models</strong> the results of a validation comparison of the Nagelkerke R-square and the C statistic for the “augmented model” Z to the “main effects” model Y through the <code>validate</code> function in <code>lrm</code> fits.</li>
<li><strong>Final Model</strong> This section should end with a clear statement of the model you prefer (the “main effects” model Y or the “augmented” model Z) based on your overall assessment of fit quality, and whether adding the terms in the augmented model yields an improvement that is worth the complication of adding the non-linear terms.
<ul>
<li>You should land on a single, final model, using both statistical and non-statistical considerations to make a decision between models Y and Z.</li>
<li>An appropriate summary of the final model you landed on should start with a listing of the model parameters for a model fit to the entire data set (after imputation as needed) in terms of odds ratios, with appropriate confidence intervals, and a table or (better) plot of the effect sizes.
<ul>
<li>Specify the effect sizes for all elements of your final model numerically (with both an odds ratio point estimate and a confidence interval), and graphically (with a plot of those effects (probably through <code>plot(summary(yourmodel)</code>), properly interpreted.</li>
<li>Then write a detailed and correct description of the effect of <strong>at least one</strong> predictor on your outcome for your chosen logistic regression model, providing all necessary elements of such a description, and link this directly to what the plot is telling you.</li>
<li>We prefer you discuss a meaningful effect, should one exist. Pick an effect to describe that is interesting to you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, we want you to provide a plot of the ROC curve for the “final model” in the entire data set.</li>
<li>You should display an appropriate (corrected through validation) estimate of Nagelkerke R-square and the C statistic for your final model, using the entire data set.</li>
<li>The final part of your summary of the final model should be a nomogram with a demonstration of a predicted probability associated with two new subjects of interest that differ in terms of some of the parameters in your model.
<ul>
<li>Your predictions in Section 9 should describe two different subjects. You don’t have to call them Harry and Sally, but it is helpful to give them actual names.</li>

</ul>

<p>Your audience for this presentation includes Professor Love, the TAs and your fellow students. Prepare your presentation with that audience in mind. What will they need to know to understand what you’ve done, and get excited about it?</p>
</section>
<section id="outline-of-the-presentation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outline-of-the-presentation">Outline of the Presentation</h2>
<p>Your presentation should include fewer than 10 slides.</p>
<p>Your “most important finding” is just going to be one of many potentially interesting findings in your Project. Your job in the presentation is <strong>not</strong> to prove to me that you did a lot of work - I’ll see that in the portfolio.</p>
<p>Instead, your job in the presentation is to interest your audience in something you found that is (at least relatively) important. You are expected to help us understand the following things related to your most important finding, based on either a linear or logistic model.</p>
<p>You will not be developing any new material for the slides (just restating and rearranging things you’ve already done and perhaps constructing a short narrative to help us retain your key findings) once you have the portfolio. As a result, we encourage you to complete the portfolio first.</p>
<p>We suggest you develop about 8 slides. This should include…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A title slide</li>
<li>A couple of slides to describe the Subjects, Outcome and Predictors
<ul>
<li>Make sure we understand who the subjects are, how they were selected, what the outcome is and why we should care about it, and what predictors are involved in the model you’ll show.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several slides showing meaningful statistical findings (What should we learn from your model?)
<ul>
<li>What does the model (don’t show us details of multiple models in the presentation) say about the relationship between the outcome and the predictors?</li>
<li>You’re only showing us one model (of models A, B, Y and Z) in the presentation.</li>
<li>How well does this model fit the data you have, and how well might it fit in new data?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A couple of slides discussing next steps
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely that you’ll have a model that is truly satisfactory all on its own, so what could be done to improve it that you cannot already do with the data you have? What other data could be collected, how could the measures be refined, could you design a study to get to a more convincing answer?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that you introduce yourself when you start to speak, over your title slide if you are working alone. We’re happy to see your face during the presentation, but this isn’t mandatory. If you are working with a partner, each of you should introduce yourself at the beginning, and let me know who’s speaking first.</p>
<p>(Essentially) <strong>every word and every image/table/chart</strong> in your slides can and should come directly from the materials contained in your HTML portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>The development of the presentation is mostly about selecting useful information to present and then arranging it in a way that sticks for your audience.</li>
<li>Your presentation should include no R code but instead will provide nicely formatted figures and tables along with text. Some figures don’t work well on slides, like nomograms, without a lot of work. Pick something that is both useful and easy to see.</li>
<li>Each slide should have a title, indicating the message you want us to get from the slide (don’t use generic titles like “Results” or “Table 1”).</li>
<li>You’ll have to cut out around 95% of your portfolio to create your slides, and you should follow your instincts regarding your audience (Professor Love, the TAs and your fellow students are your audience.)</li>
<li>Developing the presentation is where <strong>you</strong> have to make decisions about what’s most important to show an audience to get them interested in your work. That’s a critically important skill.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="on-p-values-and-statistical-significance" class="level1">
<h1>On P values and “statistical significance”</h1>
<p>You are welcome to include p values in your analyses in either the portfolio or the presentation, but you should demonstrate good statistical practice by not comparing them to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> levels to declare things to be important, meaningful, or significant.</p>
<p><strong>You should not use the words “statistically significant” or any synonyms (like statistically detectable) in any of your Plan or Portfolio materials nor in your presentation.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="on-missing-data" class="level1">
<h1>On Missing Data</h1>
<p>For Project A, we generally regard the use of imputation as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>essential</strong> if you have missing predictor values for more than 10% of your subjects, <em>and</em> more than 50 subjects</li>
<li><strong>unnecessary</strong> if you have missing predictor values for less than 1% of your subjects, <em>and</em> fewer than 10 subjects</li>
<li>probably worth doing if your data don’t meet either of those standards</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <strong>very</strong> important to us that people use imputation in their Project A if that is appropriate. It is <strong>not at all</strong> important to us whether people choose single imputation or multiple imputation for that task in Project A.</p>
<p>The five key questions we’ll be asking ourselves when evaluating your Project A regarding how you deal with missing data are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For Project A, we encourage you to exclude subjects with missing outcome data, and to do this separately for your linear modeling and your logistic modeling, all working off the same initial data, but with different “cuts”. Have you successfully done this, so that each model is fit with as much data as are available?</li>
<li>Now that you’ve removed the missing outcomes, do you have a very small number and proportion of subjects with missing predictors for the models you’re fitting, so that simply dropping cases with missing data is not a substantial concern?
<ul>
<li>For example, suppose your study has 1000 observations with complete data on your outcome, and 990 of those (or 99%) have complete data on all predictors. So you have 10 observations with missing data, and that’s 1% of your total observations. If you are willing to assume MAR, whether you do complete cases, single imputation or multiple imputation, you’ll get very similar results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are you assuming about the missing data mechanism and why is that assumption reasonable?
<ul>
<li>You’re all going to wind up assuming either MCAR (in which case a complete cases analysis is appropriate) or MAR (in which case single or multiple imputation is required). You should be providing an argument for your choice (which includes why MNAR isn’t the most suitable assumption.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does your code (complete cases, single imputation or multiple imputation) work to produce the results you need?</li>
<li>Can you interpret the coefficients produced by your model appropriately?</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ve probably figured out already that questions 4-5 are the most important ones.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-transformations" class="level1">
<h1>On Transformations</h1>
<p>In Project A, restrict yourself to understandable outcome transformations, and don’t be a slave to the Box-Cox approach, which after all is only designed to help with some very particular issues. The reasonable transformations to consider are <span class="math inline">\(1/y\)</span>, a logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the square root of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything more complicated than that should suggest that you consider a different modeling approach or revision to your outcome.</li>
<li>There is no point in demonstrating all possible transformations in your final work. Describe the transformation you make and your reason for it, then move on.</li>
<li>If you use a transformation of an outcome, please back-transform out of that in presenting final prediction results where possible, perhaps in a nomogram or a demonstration of what the model predicts for a pair of fictional subjects like “Harry and Sally.”</li>
</ul>
<section id="using-splines-and-other-complex-predictors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-splines-and-other-complex-predictors">Using Splines and other Complex Predictors</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How should I describe a restricted cubic spline that I’ve fit in a model? Do I write out that equation with the variablename’ and variablename’’ in it, or … ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell us how many knots were involved and show a graph that depicts the impact of the spline.</p>
<ul>
<li>No one explains splines without a graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a graph and use it is excellent advice for many aspects of your presentation. Sensible graphs to accomplish this task in a multivariate regression model include the <code>ggplot</code> with <code>Predict</code> combination, the <code>plot(summary())</code> approach, and/or a nomogram.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-selection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variable-selection">Variable Selection</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the best way to select an appropriate set of predictors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends in part on the kind of question you are trying to answer. For most projects, I recommend a question that is explicitly about prediction, rather than either (a) trying to explain a phenomenon in existing data without reference to external prediction or (b) trying to make some sort of causal inference, which requires methods beyond the scope of this class.</p>
<p>What I would always try to do is start with a question I want to answer, which should motivate specific predictors. A combination of logic, theory and prior empirical evidence is always preferable. A scan of the literature is always useful. A conceptual model of the relationship which makes predictions about what “should” happen under current understanding can be very helpful. I strongly urge you to pick a project where you have some prior understanding of how the data will behave and where you can express that pre-modeling belief as part of your presentation of your work.</p>
<p>What I would definitely not do is scan a list of correlations in the current data to see which ones look promising, and then forget that I did that when it came time to evaluate the models I developed. It’s fine to go on a fishing expedition here, but then you have to severely temper your claims, and in particular you have to give up on drawing any substantial conclusions about causation or explanation and focus instead on a question about prediction, and (of course) validation of your model becomes essential.</p>
